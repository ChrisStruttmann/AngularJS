# AngularJS

## Task
Implement a four function calculator with a history-buffer similar to the calculator found in Windows or other operating systems. Allow a user to retrieve a value out of the history buffer by double-clicking on the entry. 

Stub a function called historyBufferChanged() which will get called every time the history buffer changes, also stub a function called historyBufferRestored() any time a user decides to restore a value from a history buffer. 

## Other Requirements
* Fork this repository (please use SSH git URL, not HTTP)
* Build each of the four functions of the calculator in a separate feature branch 
* Build stub functions in a separate feature branch
* Include a screenshot of "git remote -v" and "git status" in your final commit.
* Submit a pull request to this project when done


## Good luck.
